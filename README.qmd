#### Abstract

Forecast combination leverages the information captured by multiple models to produce more accurate forecasts. There are several methods to combine multiple forecasts effectively. Ensemble forecasting uses forecasts of the same time series from various models, helping to mitigate model misspecification by averaging predictions. Decomposition forecasting combines forecasts from a time series that has been broken down into simpler, individual components, making it easier to forecast each part separately. Forecast reconciliation adjusts forecasts from multiple related time series to ensure they adhere to a coherent structure, thereby sharing information between the series. In this talk, I will discuss each of these combination strategies in the context of infectious disease forecasting, with demonstrations using the distributional R package.
